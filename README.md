Individial Project

The objective of this project is to put oriented bounding boxes on vehicles in a real street LiDAR scene in Hong Kong. The detector should be invariant to partial occlusion, deformation, and noises, and varying degrees of point density - all of which are ubiquitous caveats in LiDAR clouds.
