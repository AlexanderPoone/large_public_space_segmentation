Individial Project

The objective of this project is to put oriented bounding boxes on vehicles in a real street LiDAR scene in Hong Kong. The detector should be invariant to partial occlusion, deformation, noises, and varying degrees of point density - all of which are ubiquitous caveats in LiDAR clouds.

In case you are wondering, I made the dataset myself. The points have only INTENSITY values and no RGB values.
